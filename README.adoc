= AsciiDoc to Slides

This projects aims to provide an easy way to create slides from AsciiDoc -
both for online use (e.g. revealJS) and offline use (pdf).

It uses several projects:

* https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/
* https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape
* based on the revealJS example from: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-examples

== Usage

Currently, all pathes / etc. are hard-coded. When the first beta is released,
a better description follows.

* change example-deck.adoc
* run `./gradlew renderSlides`
